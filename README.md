This repository provides an implementation for the generation of UAV trajectories among given waypoints, in the presence of geo-fencing and no-fly zones, along with time, distance and cost for the generated routes. Additionally, it automatically generates time and distance matrices to be used by routing modules. 

A more detailed description of the module will be included soon.
